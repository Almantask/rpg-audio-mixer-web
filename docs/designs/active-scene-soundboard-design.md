## Purpose

The Soundboard tab sits alongside the Soundscapes tab within an Active Scene. It gives the GM a grid of one-shot FX buttons to trigger sound effects instantly during play — thunder, door creaks, combat sounds, etc.

## Components

### Top Bar
- Back arrow → returns to previous screen
- Scene name as title
- **Session Lock Toggle** (🔒) → Disables destructive gestures (reordering, deleting) and scene switching.
- ⚙️ gear icon top-right → navigates to Credits

### Session Control Bar
- **Global Master Stop (Panic Button)**: A prominent button that immediately fades out all soundscapes and stops all sound effects.

### Scene Notes
- Expandable markdown-capable text area for storing DM cues, descriptions, and reminders specific to the scene.

### Master Volume Slider
- A single horizontal slider controlling the output volume for **all** effects equally
- There is **no** per-effect volume control — Master only
- **Natural Volume Progression**: Uses a **Cubic ($x^3$) mapping** for the volume scale to ensure a natural hearing progression.
- **Arcanum Motion**: Sliders use specific motion tokens for tactile feedback.
- Snaps instantly to saved value on scene load — no animation

### Effect Button Grid
- 4-column grid layout
- Each button shows a relevant material icon and the FX name (truncated if needed)
- No category grouping — all effects appear in one flat grid
- **Low-Latency Soundboard**: All FX MUST be played via **SoundPool** to ensure near-zero latency response when triggered.

**Playing state:** when a sound is currently playing, the button glows/pulses and shows ⏸.

**Re-trigger behaviour:** tapping a button that is already playing starts a new instance from the beginning — the in-progress instance continues alongside the new one (overlap, not replace).

**Stop behaviour:** tapping ⏸ on a button stops that instance and reverts the button to ▶.

### Drag-to-Reorder
Effect buttons can be long-pressed or dragged to reorder their position in the grid. **Disabled when Session Lock is active.**

### Add New Effect Button
- **+ ADD NEW EFFECT** pinned at the end of the grid (or as a dedicated button below the grid)
- Opens the FX Selection view (see below)

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- No tab highlighted (Active Scene is not a top-level tab screen)

## Interactions & Behaviour

| Interaction | Result |
|---|---|
| Drag Master slider | Adjusts output volume for all effects in real time |
| Tap an effect button (idle) | Starts playing; button glows/pulses and shows ⏸ |
| Tap an effect button (playing) | **Re-triggers** — new instance starts from beginning; prior instance continues |
| Tap ⏸ on a button | Stops that effect's current instance; button reverts to ▶ / idle state |
| Long-press and drag a button | Reorders it in the grid. **Disabled if Session Lock is ON.** |
| Hold and drag button to Flames area | Hold the button until a "Trash" zone with flames overlay appears at the bottom screen; dropping removes the effect from scene. **Disabled if Session Lock is ON.** |
| Tap **+ ADD NEW EFFECT** | Opens the FX Selection overlay |

### FX Selection View (ADD NEW EFFECT)
- A simplified overlay/sheet presenting:
  - Back button (closes without selecting)
  - Scrollable list or grid of all FX tracks from the global FX Library
  - Multi-select: GM picks one or more to add to the scene's soundboard
  - Confirm button adds selected effects

---

## States

### Populated grid
Effects shown in 4-column grid. Some may be playing (glowing) simultaneously.

### Empty grid
Empty area with **+ ADD NEW EFFECT** as the primary CTA.

### Loading
Centred spinner until scene data is ready.

### Error state
If an error occurs (e.g. audio file not found, playback failure), a **scrollable message box** appears as an overlay. The message box contains the error details and a dismiss button. Other effects that are playing are not interrupted.
